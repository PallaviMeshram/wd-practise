            The <b>metaverse</b> is a hypothesized <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iteration" >iteration</a> of the Internet, supporting persistent online 3-D "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_environment">virtual environments</a><sup>[1][2][3]</sup> through conventional personal computing, as well as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality">virtual</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality">augmented reality</a> headsets.<sup>[4][3]</sup>
            </p>
            <p>Metaverses, in some limited form, have already been implemented in video games such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life">Second Life.</a><sup>[5]</sup> Some iterations of the metaverse involve integration between virtual and physical spaces and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_economy">virtual economies.</a><sup>[3]</sup></p> 
            <p>Current metaverse development is centered on addressing the technological limitations with virtual and augmented reality devices.<sup>[6][7][8]</sup></p>
            <p>The term "metaverse" has its origins in the 1992 science fiction novel <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_Crash">Snow Crash</a> as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portmanteau">portmanteau</a> of "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta">meta</a>" and "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe">universe.</a>" It has since gained notoriety as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzzword">buzzword</a> for promotion, and as a way to generate hype for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_relations">public relations</a> purposes by making vague claims for future projects.<sup>[4][9]</sup> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_privacy">Information privacy</a> and user addiction are concerns within the metaverse, stemming from challenges facing the social media and video game industries as a whole.<sup>[10][4][11]</sup></p>

       <hr/>
       <h3>Video games</h3>
       <p>
        Several components of metaverse technologies have already been developed within modern internet-enabled <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game">video games.</a><sup>[5]</sup> The 2003 video game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life">Second Life</a> is often described as the first metaverse,<sup>[12][13]</sup> as it incorporated many aspects of social media into a persistent virtual world. Social functions are often an integral feature in many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massively_multiplayer_online_game">massively multiplayer online games.</a> Technology journalist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clive_Thompson_(journalist)">Clive Thompson</a> has argued that the emergent, social-based gameplay of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minecraft">Minecraft</a> represents an advanced implementation of the metaverse.<sup>[14]</sup> Similar statements were made for the game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roblox">Roblox</a>,<sup>[15][16]</sup> which has since employed significant <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzzword">usage of the term in marketing.</a><sup>[17]</sup> Other claims of developing a metaverse include the games <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Worlds">Active Worlds</a>,<sup>[18]</sup> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Palace_(computer_program)">The Palace</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentraland">Decentraland</a>,<sup>[19]</sup> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortnite">Fortnite</a><sup>[20]</sup> in addition to a few early <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD">MUD</a> games.<sup>[21][22]</sup></p>
        <h3>Virtual reality</h3>
        <p>Metaverse development has often focused on bettering <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality">virtual reality</a> technologies due to benefits in establishing immersion in virtual environments. In 2019, the social network company <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook">Facebook</a> launched a social VR world called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizon_Worlds">Facebook Horizon.</a><sup>[23]</sup> In 2021 Facebook was renamed "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms">Meta Platforms</a>" and its chairman <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg">Mark Zuckerberg</a><sup>[24]</sup>(subscription required) declared a company commitment to developing a metaverse ecosystem,<sup>[25]</sup> as much of the underlying virtual reality technology remains to be developed.<sup>[26][27][28]</sup> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft">Microsoft</a> acquired the VR company <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AltspaceVR">AltspaceVR</a> in 2017,<sup>[29]</sup> and is planning on integrating metaverse features into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Teams">Microsoft Teams.</a><sup>[30]</sup></p>
        <p>Some developers have proposed using metaverse technology for improvements in work productivity<sup>[31][32]</sup> or as a way to allow for interactive environments for learning.<sup>[10]</sup> The metaverse could also host virtual reality home tours in the real estate sector.<sup>[10]</sup></p>

            <hr/>
            <p>The metaverse is a proposed expansion to existing internet technologies.[6] Access points for the metaverse include general-purpose computers and smartphones, in addition to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality">augmented reality</a> (AR), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_reality">mixed reality</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality">virtual reality</a> (VR), and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_World">virtual world</a> technologies.<sup>[6]</sup></p>
            <p>Business and commercial interest in metaverse-related research and technology include Facebook, which bought VR company <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oculus_(brand)">Oculu</a>s in 2014, and has announced plans to build a 3-D social space to connect varying services.<sup>[7]</sup></p>
            <p>The metaverse's dependency on VR technology places limitations on its development and wide-scale adoption.<sup>[6]</sup> Limitations stemming from the balance between cost and design include the lack of high-quality graphics and a lack of mobility. Lightweight wireless headsets lack image quality, which is optimized for bulky, wired VR goggle systems.<sup>[7]</sup> Another issue for wide-scale adoption of the technology is the cost, with the HTC Vive Pro 2 headset costing US$799 plus controllers in 2021.<sup>[7]</sup></p>
            <p>In 2021, the South Korean government announced the creation of a national metaverse alliance with the goal to build a unified national VR and AR platform.<sup>[33]</sup></p>
            <h3>Technical standards</h3>
            <p>Common standards, interfaces, and communication protocols among virtual environments are in development. Collaborations and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_groups">working groups</a> are attempting to create standards and protocols to support interoperability between virtual environments, including:</p>

            <h2 style="font-weight: normal;">Criticism and concerns</h2>
            <hr/>
            <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_privacy">Information privacy</a> is an area of concern because the companies involved will likely collect users' personal information through wearable devices and user interactions.<sup>[41]</sup> Facebook is planning on persisting targeted advertising within the metaverse, raising further worries related to the spread of misinformation and loss of personal privacy.<sup>[4]</sup></p>
            <p>User addiction and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problematic_social_media_use">problematic social media use</a> is another concern. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_addiction_disorder">Internet addiction disorder</a>, social media, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_addiction">video game addiction</a> can have mental and physical repercussions over a prolonged period of time, such as depression, anxiety, and obesity.<sup>[11]</sup> Experts are also concerned that the metaverse could be used as an 'escape' from reality in a similar fashion to existing internet technologies.<sup>[41][42]</sup></p>
            <p>The metaverse may magnify the social impacts of online echo chambers and digitally alienating spaces.<sup>[3][43]</sup> Since metaverse developments may be made to algorithmically tailor virtual worlds based on each person's beliefs, the metaverse may further distort users' perceptions of reality with biased content to maintain or increase engagement.<sup>[43][44]</sup></p>

            <h3>Snow Crash, 1992</h3>
            <p>The term metaverse was coined in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neal_Stephenson">Neal Stephenson</a>'s 1992 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction">science fiction</a> novel <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_Crash">Snow Crash</a>, where humans, as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar_(computing)">avatars</a>, interact with each other and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_agent">software agents</a>, in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_computer_graphics">three-dimensional</a> virtual space that uses the metaphor of the real world.<sup>[45]</sup> Stephenson used the term to describe a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality">virtual reality</a>-based successor to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet">internet.</a><sup>[46]</sup></p>
            <p>Neal Stephenson's metaverse appears to its users as an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_area">urban</a> environment developed along a 100-meter-wide road, called the Street, which spans the entire <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_E7_m">65536 km</a> (2<sup>16</sup> km) circumference of a featureless, black, perfectly spherical planet. The virtual <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate">real estate</a> is owned by the Global Multimedia Protocol Group, a fictional part of the real <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_for_Computing_Machinery">Association for Computing Machinery,</a> and is available to be bought and buildings developed thereupon.<sup>[47]</sup></p>
            <p>Users of the metaverse access it through personal terminals that project a high-quality virtual reality display onto goggles worn by the user, or from grainy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_and_white">black and white</a> public terminals in booths. The users experience it from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_person_(video_games)">first-person perspective.</a> Stephenson describes a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub-culture">sub-culture</a> of people choosing to remain continuously connected to the metaverse; they are given the sobriquet "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gargoyle">gargoyles</a>" due to their grotesque appearance.<sup>[47]</sup></p>
            <p>Within the metaverse, individual users appear as avatars of any form, with the sole restriction of height, "to prevent people from walking around a mile high". Transport within the metaverse is limited to analogs of reality by foot or vehicle, such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorail">monorail</a> that runs the entire length of the Street, stopping at 256 Express Ports, located evenly at 256 km intervals, and Local Ports, one kilometer apart.<sup>[47]</sup></p>
            <h3>Ready Player One, 2011</h3>
            <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ready_Player_One">Ready Player One</a> is a 2011 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dystopia">dystopian</a> science fiction novel by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Cline">Ernest Cline</a>, depicting the world in the year 2045 as being gripped by an energy crisis and global warming, causing widespread social problems and economic stagnation. The primary escape for people is a metaverse called the OASIS, which is accessed with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality_headset">VR headset</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wired_glove">wired gloves.</a> It functions both as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massively_multiplayer_online_role-playing_game">massively multiplayer online role-playing game</a> and as a virtual society. A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ready_Player_One_(film)">film adaptation</a> was released in 2018.</p>
